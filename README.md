Using the following tools to create a farm/warehouse detection software with the help of IoT tools:
1. ESP 32 for WiFi RSSI values
  - Buzzer sounds if RSSI is below threshold (-55)
2. Temperature Sensing
3. Ultrasonic Sensor for distance detection
  - LEDs are powered on based on the distance

* All measurements including RSSI, temperature and distance are graphed and displayed on InfluxDB and Grafana
* API Key was added as a new one was generated
